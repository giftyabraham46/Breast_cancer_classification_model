📌 Project Overview

Early detection of breast cancer plays a crucial role in effective treatment.
This project uses a supervised classification approach to analyze medical data and predict whether a tumor is:

Malignant (Cancerous)
Benign (Non-cancerous)

🧠 Machine Learning Approach

Algorithm Used: Logistic Regression
Type: Binary Classification
Evaluation Metric: Accuracy Score

🛠️ Technologies & Libraries Used

Python
NumPy – numerical computations
Pandas – data manipulation and analysis
Scikit-learn – machine learning models and evaluation

📂 Dataset

Dataset used from sklearn.datasets contains features computed from breast mass images

Target labels:

0 → Malignant
1 → Benign

⚙️ Workflow

Load the breast cancer dataset
Convert data into a Pandas DataFrame
Split data into training and testing sets
Train a Logistic Regression model
Evaluate model performance using accuracy score

📊 Model Performance

The model achieves good accuracy in classifying tumors
Suitable for understanding basic ML classification pipelines
